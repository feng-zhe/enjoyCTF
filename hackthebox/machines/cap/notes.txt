# Enum
## 21 ftp
vsftpd 3.0.3 => only a DoS attack exploit
tried to login with no pass, failed.

## 80 http
looks like a dashboard to monitor something.
found user name "Nathan"
the "ipconfig" and "network status" looks like a command result.
gobuster brute force the commands => no
gobuster brute force dir name =>
/data                 (Status: 302) [Size: 208] [--> http://cap.htb/]
/ip                   (Status: 200) [Size: 17448]
/capture              (Status: 302) [Size: 220] [--> http://cap.htb/data/2]
nothing new.

But combine with 21 ftp failed login attempt, the /capture can return some data.
The URL is /data/4, tried other numbers, found /data/0 is big. The IP addresses are different. Not me.
But the FTP data, user nathan, password Buck3tH4TF0RM3!
ssh => foohold

# Priv Esc
linpeas.sh => priv esc exploit => try the first one => root
