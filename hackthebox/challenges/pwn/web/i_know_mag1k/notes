registered a user admin
=>
cookie 'PHPSESSID' is rs0tl0fs5f70d1n408a6s6stj0
cookie 'iknowmag1k' is a base64 and other encoded data.

after base64 decrypted, tried:
hash-identifier => not hash
bruteforce-salted-openssl => reports it is not a salted openssl file.

google php encrypt => find openssl_encrypt and [mcrypt_encrypt](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-encrypt.php). 
The openssl has been ruled out. Thus it could be mcrypt_encrypt. The manual says it is vuln to padding oracle attack.
look into the base64 decrypted value, size can be divided by 8 => block size 8

use padbuster and -plaintext to get the encrypted cookie which has role field set to 'admin'.
=> get the flag.
