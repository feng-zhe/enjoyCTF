# 2026-02-01 to 2026-02-03
Shamefully, I gaped for a year and started again in 2026 :). Happily, I had my first baby born. It will be more challenging to build my cybersec career, as expected. But this is great. Not an execuse for staying in my comfort zone.

Using the first-principles thinking, to be a cybersec expert, someone has to have adequate related knowledge and a lot of practice. Considering my education background and work, I believe I have solid knowledge but lack of practice, e.g. I know how bufferflow/ret2libc works in theory, but I am not familiar with how to use pwntools to exploit them.

So, let's just practice. Face the fear. In these days, I was re-practicing the HTB challenges "Space Pirate: Entrypoint" (FSB vuln)  and "Regularity" (BF + jmp_rsi + shellcode). I also learnt the pwninit tool which eases the initial tasks. And I don't just practice them once and then forget them. I repeat the solution every morning until it becomes natural.

Like what I learned from my first OSCP failure: I've already have everything I need, I just don't trust myself and don't know how to use them.

Again, no execuse to stay in the comfort zone.
