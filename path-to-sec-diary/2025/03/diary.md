Samefully I didn't do anything yesterday.

Today, I worked on the "Sacred Scrolls: Revenge". Haven't found anything
interesting yet. Only a 7-byte overflow thing. Now sure how we will use it to
read the flag.

Will see how it goes tomorrow.

Struggling with the "very easy" challenge "Sacred Scrolls: Revenge". Looks like
I forgot all things about the ret2libc. Learned a lot from this challenge.
Unfortunately, the challenge itself has an issue so that I cannot finish it.

Will adjust my goal to finish all the pwn up to the medium difficulty. And then
start to find CVEs among the well-known public softwares. I can do this!

finished the pwn challenge "Entity". Very easy. First-time coding the solver.py
with pwn totally alone.

Finished the Space-pirate-Going-Deeper pwn challenge. Wasted some time trying to
bypass the param123 checks. Then I realized I can jump to the right place by
overwriting one-byte of the return address since the binary has PIE disabled.

Well, this is awkward. I wish I have taking hacker diary as frequently as my
fishing diary :)

I've finished all very-easy level pwn challenges. I have to adjust my plan: I
should only solve all easy challenges and then start seaking the
vulnerabilities. Not saying I will not continue doing the harder problems. I
just want to get hands dirty quickly and see what I lack so that I can learn
something with a purpose. In my current situation, time is very precious. I have
to spend it wisely.
