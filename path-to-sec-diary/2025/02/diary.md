Today is the first day that I start to keep a diary recording my path to become
a security researcher/pen tester.

TBH, I want to become one since long time ago. I tried at several times but all
failed. Some failed in a funny way :) :

- When I was in college, I begged some senior student to take me into his sec
  company and learn from them. But I quit soon, because it was so overwhelming.
  I was very inmature at that time.
- After I graduated in 2015, I worked in SAP China Labs for two years. But I
  still feel I want to be a sec researcher. The desire grew so strong that I
  quit my job, applied USA college for master degree to seek for sec
  oppurtunities later since I believe it is a more open-minded world.
  Half-restarted my life basically in 2018.
  - Unfotunately, there is no "sec eng" major, so I chose Computer Engineering.
    Looking forward to get a sec eng job later.
  - During this time, I passed the OSCP (Offensive Security Certified
    Professional). Hoping it can help me when I see for a sec job.
- After I finished my master degree in 2019, I only got one interview and one
  offer from Google, not sec-related. I have no choice otherwise I have to go
  back to China which will make all my efforts wasted. So I take it, hoping to
  switch to sec jobs later in Google.
- During pandemic, I saw there is a 6-month rotation program that I can work in
  sec eng team. I was excited and informed my manager right way. However, after
  that, I noticed that the program actualy required "your manager to keep your
  headcount in your team". My manager told me "that wouldn't work for the team".
  So I end up finding the next team in one week. Good news is that the new team
  is a sec team of a cloud product. The bad news is that I am still a SWE so I just code for security features. Not the sec job I want. But I need a job to put food on my table.
  - I enrolled the OSCE during this time, however, I finished the course but didn't take the exam. I am not ready. And I am not sure pen tester is what I want to do

Well, that is about it. I want to keep a diary so that I can push myself and remind myself daily. I am 33-year old now. I feel this will be my last chance to pursuit my dream. Later, the burden of life may not give me the luxury to try again.

So the current plan is to prepare some CVEs on my resume. Then I can seek for related jobs. I feel I am more interested in CVEs like CVE-2024-1086 because of its impact and complexity. However, I cannot understand its post https://pwning.tech/nftables/. I feel I need to get some solid fundations first.

A bonus of trying to read above CVE blogpost is that I noticed the author is also playing HTB, likely for some practicing or learning. This is already what I am doing. Yeah.

So my current goal is to finish all pwn challeges in HTB challenges. I've finished all leetcode problems when I prepare for Google interview. I am not afraid of this.

The next step could be start reviewing easier but same-type CVEs and see if I can duplicate the vuln/process/workflow and find vulns on other places. However, this will be something to worry about later.
